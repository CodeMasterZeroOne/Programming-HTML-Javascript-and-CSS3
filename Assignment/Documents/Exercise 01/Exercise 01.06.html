    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_once_was_a_man_from_Nantucket">“The Man from Nantucket”</a>
    <h4>The earliest published version of “The Man from Nantucket” appeared in 1902 in the
        Princeton Tiger written by Professor Dayton Voorhees.</h4>
    <p>There once was a man from Nantucket<br>
        Who kept all his cash in a bucket.<br>
        But his daughter, named Nan,<br>
        Ran away with a man<br>
        And as for the bucket, Nantucket.</p>
    <h4>Other publications seized upon the "Nantucket" motif, spawning many sequels.
        Among the most well-known are:</h4>
    <p>But he followed the pair to Pawtucket,<br>
        The man and the girl with the bucket;<br>
        And he said to the man,<br>
        He was welcome to Nan,<br>
        But as for the bucket, Pawtucket.</p>
    <h4>Followed later by:</h4>
    <p>Then the pair followed Pa to Manhasset,<br>
        Where he still held the cash as an asset,<br>
        But Nan and the man<br>
        Stole the money and ran,<br>
        And as for the bucket, Manhasset.</p>
